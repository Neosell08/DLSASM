This is a project where I created my own CPU in Logisim and then created my own assembly-like programming languages to interact with it and create programs for the CPU. Check Report.pdf for a more detailed explanation.


To run:
download Logisim: https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/
Open the CPU.circ file
Write your NeoLang code in neo.neo
compile by running NEO.py
Open Logisim, right click on the ROM component, and click load image, and then choose the file named code
Now run the program by clicking ctrl+r to reset then ctrl+k to simulate.
If the program requires the keyboard you can click ctrl+1 and then click the keyboard component to input characters using your keyboard.
